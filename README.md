# Fraunhofer-Diffraction-Simulation
Fraunhofer diffraction simulation script. Script was made to produce simulated Fraunhofer diffraction patterns that could be compared with diffraction patterns that had been recorded in the lab. Simulates Fraunhofer diffraction by various methods.

The code is commented extensively with an explanation for almost every line.

Fraunhofer diffraction is simulated for a single slit, a pinhole and in a diffraction grating. In each scenario it is possible to vary a number of parameters relating to the formation of teh diffraction pattern
